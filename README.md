# Sign-Language-Recognation
Sign Language Recognition, a desktop application designed to assist individuals who are deaf or have hearing impairments to communicate more effectively by translating their sign language into natural language. In order to implement this application, I have created my own dataset consisting of various signs used in sign language and trained a model with this dataset. This project has the potential to significantly improve accessibility and inclusivity for individuals with hearing impairments, by providing a tool that can help them communicate more effectively with others.
